## 🚀 Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## 📃 Project

This project was developed to be a website that connects students to tutors. Tutors can register their professional information and provide a Whatsapp number so that students can easily contact them via a Whatsapp's API button after a search categorized by subject they want to learn, week day and time.

The application backend was built based on Node.js, with the Express.js framework due to the ease of use and support for plug-ins. Using a template engine called Nunjucks it was possible to facilitate the structure of sending dynamic content, from requests made to an SQL database, to the HTML pages. The SQLite database was chosen for this project because it is lightweight, has good a documentation and is widely used by developers, as well as being easy to create asynchronous queries using the Sqlite-async library.
